### Getting Started

Open common/config/main-local.php, and edit db connection.

Before you can go on you need to use following command, which allows you to create table for storing users data:

~~~
yii migrate
~~~

Open common/config/main.php and add to components, if it's not exists:

~~~
'authManager' => [
   'class' => 'yii\rbac\DbManager',
],
~~~

After that you should prepare some tables for DbManager to store its data. Use following command:

~~~
yii migrate --migrationPath=@yii/rbac/migrations
~~~

Create RbacController.php in console/controllers, if it's not exists. To build authorization data you should use this command:

~~~
yii rbac/init
~~~

Then you have to update composer, usage:

~~~
composer update
~~~
